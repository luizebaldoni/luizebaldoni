# 👋 Hey, I'm Luize Baldoni!

## 🚀 About me

My name is **Luize Baldoni de Oliveira**, Brazilian from Santa Maria, RS. I have a degree in **Internet Informatics Technician** from **Colégio Técnico Industrial de Santa Maria (CTISM-UFSM)**, I am studying **Computer Engineering** at the **Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM)**, and I am passionate about technology, innovation, and software development. I am currently a member of the Hydro-Environmental Modeling and Ecotechnologies research group at **UFSM**.

## 💻 Experience and Projects

- I participated in a research and extension project in partnership with local companies and **CTISM**, focused on creating a **multi-sensor hardware for remote environments**, using the **Heltec ESP32 LoRa WiFi V2** board. In April 2022, I became a scholarship holder in the project until December of the same year. Check out the project repository: [PROJETO-HELTECESP32](https://github.com/luizebaldoni/PROJETO-HELTECESP32).
- I volunteer in a research project from the Speech Therapy course at UFSM, where I develop an Android application in Kotlin for the course's Speech Laboratory (LabFala). You can find the project repository here: [LabFala-App](https://github.com/luizebaldoni/LabFala-App).
- I am a scholarship holder in the EcoTechnologies research group at the Federal University of Santa Maria, where I research and develop technologies for remote monitoring of environments and hydrological resources.
- At the end of 2023 and beginning of 2024, we developed a website, a partnership between **UFSM** and the Military School of Santa Maria, aimed at being a forum for CMSM students. Application repository: [EstudaVagao](https://github.com/luizebaldoni/EstudaVagao).
